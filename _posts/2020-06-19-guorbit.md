[GUOrbit](https://guorbit.co.uk), developed with VueJS and bootstrap. Single page application with JAM stack. Responsiveness was not by default, and some components were difficult to fit in mobile screen. Used API for contact form, to keep from having to use a backend. There was no main challenge, although a remarkably difficult task was to put wavy footer and the carousel of team leaders (all responsive).

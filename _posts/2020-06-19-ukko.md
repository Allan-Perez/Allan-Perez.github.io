With the software team in [GUOrbit](https://guorbit.co.uk){:target="_blank"}, we are aiming to proof the technology needed for our main mission to LEO with a suborbital test flight, onboard of a weather balloon provided by [stratonauts](https://www.stratonauts.org/){:target="_blank"}. Once above the clouds, we make use of an embedded system with a high resolution camera to perform semantic segmentation
and detect where are the clouds. This has potential applications in weather forecasting, optical communications, and more. It's quite an exciting project!

In the following Terms and Conditions, The Freelance (I, Allan Perez) presents the general terms and conditions under which the professional relationship with The Client (you, the party receiving my software development services) will be based. It is necessary to state that any clause in these Terms and Conditions may be modified or extended for each specific project, in which case any modification or extension must be recorded and acknowledged by both parties in a document, email, message, or any other recoverable mean. 
# 1. Independent Contractor Clause
Each Party shall act solely as an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to give either Party the power or authority to act for, bind, or commit the other Party in any way. Nothing herein shall be construed to create the relationship of partners, principal and agent, or joint-venture partners between the Parties.

# 2. Work Report
The Freelance will update The Client on a fortnightly basis, i.e. 14-day period, reporting the status of the project and the next tasks to achieve the project's goals.

# 3. Payment Terms
No outstanding payment must exist after the end of the contract.
The Freelance will start working after the first payment (the downpayment), the amount of which shall be 20% of the total cost of the project (the agreed quote). The remaining amount will be split into two payments of the 40% of the remaining amount, the first of which will be paid after the first agreed milestone (specified in the agreement between both parties) and the last payment at the completion of the project, but before the delivery.
## A. Late Payments
Late payments will be penalized with a 5% interest in the outstanding payments for every 7 days after the date indicated in the invoice.
## B. Bank details
The bank details where the payment must be done will be indicated in the invoice.
## C. Bank transfer fees
The Bank Transfer fees of The Client's bank must be covered by The Client, therefore the amount received by The Freelance must be exactly equal to the amount indicated in the invoice.
# 4. Confidentiality
Confidential information shared with the receiving party shall remain the exclusive property of the disclosing party.
Confidential information may not include public knowledge, prior knowledge, knowledge developed independently, or third party knowledge.
## A. Ownership and use rights
After completing the payment of the agreed amount, all ownership and use rights will be transferred to The Client.

# 5. Termination
The natural termination of the professional relationship between The Freelance and The Client will expire after the last payment.
## A. Early termination
Either party may terminate the agreement with a 30-day notice. To protect The Freelance from a significant loss of income and opportunity costs, a fee for early termination will be applied. This fee will be exactly equal to 20% of the remaining amount plus any other agreed operational costs, i.e. the total agreed amount minus the amount already billed plus the agreed operational costs. The terms under section 3.A apply to this payment. 

# 6. Legal Protections
## A. Liability
It is not possible to guarantee that the software, program, or product developed by The Freelance will function as intended indefinitely or after any modification done by The Client after delivery, so The Freelance cannot be liable to The Client or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if The Freelance has advised of the possibility of such damages.

The Freelance guarantees that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, software, or other work provided, are either owned by The Freelance, or The Freelance has permission to use them.
If The Client supplies any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, software or other work, it is the sole responsibility of The Client to have the permission to use them, and The Freelance won't be liable for any ownership claim by any third party or by The Client. 

The Client's liability to The Freelance will also be limited to the amount of fees payable under the agreement between The Client and The Freelance and The Client wonâ€™t be liable to The Freelance or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if The Freelance advised The Client of them.
## B. Severability
Should any clause of the contract be found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the rest of the Terms and Conditions will remain valid.
## C. No Exclusivity
The Client and The Freelance expressly acknowledge that the agreement does not create an exclusive relationship between them. The Client is free to engage others to perform services of the same or similar nature to those provided by The Freelance, and The Freelance shall be entitled to offer and provide design services to other parties, solicit other clients, and otherwise advertise the services offered by The Freelance.
## D. Governing Law
The formation, construction, performance, and enforcement of the agreement between The Client and The Freelance shall be in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom without regard to its conflict of law provisions or the conflict of law provisions of any other jurisdiction.

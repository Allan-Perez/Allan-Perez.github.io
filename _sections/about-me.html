<p>
I'm a theoretical physics student with a strong background in software development. I come from Spain and I'm currently studying at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. I started programming when I was 14, and at 15 I got interested in machine learning and started doing courses and basic competitions. At 16, I started working as a quantitative analyst in a proprietary trading firm, applying neural networks for high frequency trading and asset allocation techniques. Later, I moved into web development. I worked for 9 months as CTO in a digital marketing startup controlling leading the development, testing, deployment, and security of our websites. There I improved my web development skills with HTML/CSS/JS/PHP, working with wordpress as a framework. After this I moved to Scotland to study theoretical physics.

While at university, I'm working as a freelance web developer and have carried out multiple successful projects. Additionally, I am also a member of Glasgow University's GUOrbit, and work as a software developer for their project <a href="http://www.guorbit.co.uk/cloudview" target="_blank">Ukko</a> (formerly CloudView).
</p>
<p>
Together, all these expriences have developed my problem solving and research skills in a multidisciplinary fashion, allowing me the opportunity to generalize my skillset. During my journey I witnessed the importance of hard work, resilience, and conscientiousness in a professional setting.

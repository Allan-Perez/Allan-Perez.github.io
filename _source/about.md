I currently work in the student society [GUOrbit](https://www.guorbit.co.uk/) as software team member, where I help on the development of deep learning vision systems for cloud recognition. 

I've previously worked on machine learning applied to financial markets, applying classic and modern techniques for pattern recognition for spotting trends.
